- Add sectors and currencies
- Compute additional diversification measure
- Download spreadsheet of strategies allocation (to csv) and evaluate and compare via join
- Multithread gathering
- Build reverse index: given a stock which positions does it come from
- Define STD format for list of positions


- Answer this question: Which of the available ETFs is the least correlated to mine?

- Given two portfolios, compute correlation of asset exposures between them (requires matching instruments).

- Build an instrument matcher database, using CC of the full set of available
  instruments across all ETFs. This should be used internally as a service to
  match and sanitize and normalize all reported holdings.

- Build a script to collect and print out a normalized form of the holdings.
  That in itself can be usful.

- Build a service to provide:
  * Download normalized holdings
  * Compute correlation in overlap between two ETFs or a portfolio and an ETF.
  * Disaggregate portfolio feature
  Basically all that the tools provide, but via a simple web interface.
